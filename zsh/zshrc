# Load plugins
# This line is odd because according to the zsh-syntax-highlight 
# this plugins should be `sourced` after `compinit` since this
# is a wrapper around `zle` but the observations gave that when included
# before `options.zsh` it's erroring to the console 
# TODO: More research, maybe there is a problema with `antibody`
source ~/.zsh_plugins.sh

source ~/dotfiles/zsh/options.zsh

# Custom functions & utilities
source ~/dotfiles/zsh/functions/functions.zsh
source ~/dotfiles/zsh/functions/fzf-functions.zsh

# Some aliases (TODO: for God sake, change the directory later!!)
source ~/dotfiles/bash_prompt/bash_aliases

# Finally set environment variables because we need some plugins
# to be (installed | loaded) before this
